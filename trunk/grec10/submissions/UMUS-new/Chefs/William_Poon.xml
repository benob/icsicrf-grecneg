The restaurant chain, first opened in the 60's, consisted of 5 branches at its peak, each branch with its own speciality and run by different family members. It was acclaimed for its authentic Cantonese Menu and was famous for the Chinese wind-dried sausages (臘腸) and wind-dried duck. It was also one of the first Chinese restaurants in London's Chinatown to introduce Clay Pot Rice (煲仔飯).
