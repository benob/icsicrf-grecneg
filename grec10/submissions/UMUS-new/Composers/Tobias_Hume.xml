 was born in 1569 because

 was admitted to the London Charterhouse in 1629, a pre-requisite to which was being at least 60 years old, though there is no certainty over this.

 published music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the lyra viol) and songs. They were gathered in two collections, The First Part of Ayres (or Musicall Humors, 1605) and Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke (1607).

 was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant lute, something which caused

 most notorious piece was "An Invention for Two to Play upone one Viole". Two bows are required and the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the larger player. This work was notated in tablature and is indeed technically possible to play. 
<REF MENTION="14" SYNFUNC="subj-det" SYNCAT="np" SEMCAT="person" ENTITY="0"><REFEX CASE="genitive" REG08-TYPE="pronoun" ENTITY="0">his</REFEX></REF>
 instructions to "drum this with the backe of your bow" in another piece, "Harke, harke," constitute the earliest known use of col legno in Western music.
